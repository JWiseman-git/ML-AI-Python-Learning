**Overview**

Trying different projects out to learn AI / ML learning principles 

**Venv**
The variety of projects requires diverse and rare package usages - an virtual environment is therefore used to keep distinct package types contained. 

#### Running a project script in CMD line
Best performed the first time - as alongside this any requirements can be downloaded easily.

```console
rem How to active the virtual environment

```
#### Activate from Python 
Should be included at the top of any main scripts used for each project included - easiest way if requirements already downloaded. 
```python
source venv/bin/activate
```
